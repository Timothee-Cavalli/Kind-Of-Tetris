# Kind-Of-Tetris


The goal is to fill the map with the "3D tetrominos"

What is interessting with this project is that, I made it so it is very modular :

 I can create "tetrominos" & maps without having more code to do or much configuration (just need to attach the correct scripts, which can be premade with prefabs)
 
 In long term why not creating a map & "3D tetromino" editor.

### Controls

 z q s d a e - to move the piece or rotate the piece
 
 tab - switch to rotation or move
 
 right click + mouse movement - move the camera
 
 left click - place the piece (can't place if the piece is red)  or take the placed piece (if no piece in hand)
 
 sroll wheel - next/prev piece
