# Kind-Of-Tetris


The goal is to fill the map with the "3D tetrominos"

What is interessting with this project is that, I made it so it is very modular :

 I can create "tetrominos" & maps without having more code to do or much configuration (just need to attach the correct scripts wich can be premade with prefabs)
 
 In long term why not creating a map & "3D tetromino" editor.

### Controls

 z q s d a e - to move the piece or rotate the piece
 
 tab - switch to rotation or move
